function ret = readFromIniFile(AppName, KeyName, filename) %#codegen
% Reads parameters from a configuration file (usually *.ini)
%  
% Syntax
%   ret = readFromIniFile(AppName, KeyName, filename) 
%
% Description
%   ret=readFromIniFile(AppName, KeyName, filename)
%
%   This function works like GetPrivateProfileString() from the Windows-API
%   that is well known for reading ini-file data. The parameters are:
%
%       AppName  = Section name of the type [xxxx]
%       KeyName  = Key name separated by an equal to sign, of the type abc = 123
%       filename = ini file name to be used
%
%       ret      = string (!) value of the key found, empty ('') if key was not
%                  found. Since it's a string, you have to convert to
%                  integers / floats on your own.
% 
% Note that AppName and KeyName are NOT case sensitive, and that whitespace
% between '=' and the value will be ignored (removed).
%
% If the key or the AppName is not found, or if the inifile does not
% exist or could not be opened, '' will be returned (this will also be 
% returned when the key is empty).
%
% Examples:
%    %a sample ini file (sample.ini) may have entries:
%    %
%    %   [XYZ]
%    %   abc=123
%    %   def=7
%    %   ; lines starting with a ; are comments
%    %   [ZZZ]
%    %   abc=890
%
% readFromIniFile('XYZ','abc', 'sample.ini') % will return '123'
%
% readFromIniFile('ZZZ','abc', 'sample.ini') % will return '890'
%
% readFromIniFile('XYZ','def', 'sample.ini') % will return '7'

% This functions is very generous about invalid inifiles.
% It takes the first matching occurence of [Secion] and Key=, and then
% returns the value found. It will NOT check for multiple sections, split
% sections, multiple keys ore similar things.
% We even ignore lines that are not sections or keys.
% Also lines beginning with a ';' (after the whitespace) will be handled as
% comments. Note that a comment can NOT follow after the value of a key in
% the same line, since we must allow the possibility for ';'s to occur in
% strings of the values...
%
% What we do is simple: Scan through the line from top to bottom, keep track
% of the current section we're in, see if we have a key, and if both section
% and key are a match, get the value and break. Done.
